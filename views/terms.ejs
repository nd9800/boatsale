Such Boats are included in Listings on the Services by Owners. You may view Listings as an unregistered visitor to the Services; however, if you wish to book a Boat or create a Listing, you must first register to create a Boatsetter Account (defined below).

BOATSETTER CANNOT AND DOES NOT CONTROL THE CONTENT CONTAINED IN ANY LISTINGS AND/OR THE CONDITION, LEGALITY OR SUITABILITY OF ANY BOATS. BOATSETTER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY AND ALL LISTINGS AND BOATS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY BOOKINGS WILL BE MADE AT THE RENTER’S AND OWNER’S OWN RISK.</p><h6>Account Registration</h6><p>In order to access certain features of the Services, and to book a Boat or create a Listing, you must register to create an account (“Boatsetter Account”) and become a Member. You may register to join the Services directly via the Services or as described in this section.</p><p>You can also register to join by logging into online accounts you may have with third-parties, such as Facebook; each such account, a “Third Party Account”, via our Services. As part of the Services, you may link your Boatsetter Account with Third Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to Boatsetter through the Services; or (ii) allowing Boatsetter to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to Boatsetter and/or grant Boatsetter access to your Third Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating Boatsetter to pay any fees or making Boatsetter subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third party service providers. By granting Boatsetter access to any Third Party Accounts, you understand that Boatsetter will access, make available and store (if applicable) any Content that you have provided to and stored in your Third Party Account (“TPA Content”) so that it is available on and through the Services via your Boatsetter Account and Boatsetter Account profile page. Unless otherwise specified in these Terms, all TPA Content, if any, will be considered to be Member Content for all purposes of these Terms. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have established in such Third Party Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third Party Accounts will be available on and through your Boatsetter Account on the Services. Please note that if a Third Party Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Boatsetter’s access to such Third Party Account is terminated by the third party service provider, then TPA Content will no longer be available on and through the Site, Services and Application. You have the ability to disable the connection between your Boatsetter Account and your Third Party Accounts, at any time, by accessing the “Account” section of the Site and Application.</p><p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.</p><p>Boatsetter makes no effort to review any TPA Content for any purpose, including but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or non-infringement and Boatsetter is not responsible for any TPA Content.</p><p>We will create your Boatsetter Account and your Boatsetter Account profile page for your use of the Services based upon the personal information you provide to us or that we obtain via a Third Party Account as described above.</p><p>You may not have more than one (1) active Boatsetter Account. You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. Boatsetter reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Boatsetter Account and your access to the Services if you create more than one (1) Boatsetter Account or if any information provided during the registration process or thereafter proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete.</p><p>You are responsible for safeguarding your password. You agree that you will not disclose your password to any third party and that you will take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your Boatsetter Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify Boatsetter of any unauthorized use of your Boatsetter Account.</p><p>Unless expressly permitted in writing by Boatsetter, you may not sell, rent, or lease your Boatsetter Account to anyone else.</p><h6>Boat Listings</h6><p>As a Member, you may create Listings. You will be asked a variety of questions about the Boat to be listed, including, but not limited to, the value, location, size, features, availability of the Boat, pricing, related rules, and financial terms. You acknowledge and agree that Listings will be made publicly available via the Services. Other Members will be able to book your Boat via the Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You understand and agree that once a Renter requests a booking of your Boat, the price for such booking may not be altered without contacting customer service (<a target="_blank">contact@boatsetter.com</a>).</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or Renter use of, a Boat in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Boat included in a Listing you post, including, but not limited to, insurance requirements, coast guard regulations, zoning laws, marina regulations, and laws governing rentals and operation of Boats and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Boatsetter assumes no responsibility for an Owner’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations. Boatsetter reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, but without obligation to do so, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that Boatsetter, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Services.</p><p>You understand and agree that Boatsetter does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for you as an Owner. If a Renter requests a booking of your Boat and uses your Boat, any agreement you enter into with such Renter is between you and the Renter and Boatsetter is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Boatsetter serves as the limited authorized payment agent of the Owner for the sole purpose of accepting payments from Renters on behalf of the Owner and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Owner.</p><p>When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Boat, including, but not limited to, requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Boat. Any Member wishing to book Boats included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements; however, as noted below, we do not attempt to confirm or verify such information.</p><p>If you are an Owner, Boatsetter makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm for booking your Boat. You acknowledge and agree that, as an Owner, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions.</p><h6>No Endorsement</h6><p>Boatsetter does not endorse any Members or Boats. Although these Terms require Members to provide accurate information, we do not attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Member’s purported identity or other information provided by such Member. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you contact via the Services. Except as provided by the Boatsetter Terms, we will not be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.</p><p>By using the Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from Boatsetter with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by an Owner against Boatsetter regarding the remittance of payments received from a Renter by Boatsetter on behalf of an Owner, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled “Limitation of Liability”.</p><h6>Bookings and Financial Terms</h6><p>If you are an Owner and a booking is requested for your Boat via the Services, you may be required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Boatsetter in its sole discretion) or the booking request may be automatically canceled. When a booking is requested via the Services, we will share with you (i) the first and last name of the Renter who has requested the booking, and, (ii) a link to the Renter’s Boatsetter Account profile page, so that you can view such information before confirming or rejecting the booking. If you are unable to confirm or decide to reject a booking of a Boat within such 24 hour period, any amounts collected by Boatsetter for the requested booking may be refunded to the applicable Renter’s credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. When you confirm a booking requested by a Renter, Boatsetter will send you an email, text message or message via the Services confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Services.</p><p>If the Renter requests a booking from one of the alternative listings and the Owner associated with such alternative listing confirms the Renter’s requested booking, then the Renter agrees to pay Boatsetter the Total Fees relating to the confirmed booking for the Boat in the alternative listing, in accordance with these Terms.</p><p>The fees displayed in each Listing are comprised of the Boat Fees and the Reservation Fees. Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Reservation Fees and Boat Fees. The Boat Fees, the Reservation Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Total Fees”. The amounts due and payable by a Renter solely relating to an Owner’s Boat which are actually collected by Boatsetter are the Boat Fees. Please note that it is the Owner, and not Boatsetter which determines the Boat Fees. The Boat Fees may include cleaning fees and / or pre-paid fuel charges, at the Owner’s discretion. &nbsp;</p><p>The Renter is liable for all fuel expenses during the term of a Bareboat Rental. &nbsp;To the extent that an Owner seeks reimbursement for fuel expenses incurred by the Renter directly from the Renter, a receipt must be presented. &nbsp;Without a receipt the Owner will be unable to obtain reimbursement. This is true if the reimbursement is processed through Boatsetter or directly between the Renter and Owner. &nbsp;Following presentation of the receipt Boatsetter may first attempt to collect from the deposit or may charge the Renter’s card if the deposit is no longer on file.</p><p>Boatsetter charges a fee to Renters based upon a percentage of the Boat Fees; this charge is referred to as the “Reservation Fees”. The Reservation Fee is added to the Boat Fees to calculate the Total Fees (which will also include applicable Taxes) displayed in the applicable Listing. Boatsetter will collect the Total Fees at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when the Owner confirms the booking within 24 hours of the booking request) and will initiate payment of the Boat Fees (less Boatsetter’s Service Fees as defined in the Fees Policy <a target="_blank" href="http://boatbound.co/fees">http://Boatsetter.co/fees</a>) to the Owner two business days provided Boatsetter has the accurate account information after the Renter arrives at the applicable Boat (except to the extent that a refund is due to the Renter).</p><p>Failure to charge any of the fees or other indulgences shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise the same in the event another fee should become due at any other time.</p><p>Should a Renter not respond to an inquiry (such as regarding a fuel expense), Boatsetter may accept and process charges for damages, late fees, or fuel on behalf of that Renter. &nbsp;If an Owner does not respond, Boatsetter may process refunds or cancellations on behalf of that Owner.</p><p>You also agree that if Boatsetter is unable to collect a debt that is due within 30 (thirty) days, it may resort to a third party recovery service for the amount owed. In the event a third party recovery service is used, you agree that Boatsetter may pursue an action against you for the original amount owed, plus any commissions or expenses (including attorneys’ fees) related to pursuing said amount.</p><h6>Agreed Exclusivity with Boatsetter</h6><p>As an Owner, you agree to use the Service to communicate and facilitate a rental with a Renter. You agree not to take any action directly or indirectly to circumvent the Service Fee Policy. If you do so, you agree that Boatsetter may charge you a fee up to $1,000 per booking, in addition to the Service Fees otherwise owed to Boatsetter. &nbsp;Boatsetter may collect the fee from future bookings or otherwise.</p><p><b><br></b></p><h6>Minimum Age to Rent</h6><p>The minimum age to rent varies by type of rental &nbsp;(Bareboat operated by Renter, Bareboat operated by a Captain hired by Renter, Time Charter (Owner operated)). For all boats that are not covered under the Peer-to-Peer Boat Rental Insurance Policy through Geico (ie. have their own policy), the minimum age to rent a Boat is 18. For Bareboat rentals operated by Renter and insured through the policy made available via the Services during the rental, the minimum age is 25 and each Renter must pass a Renter verification. For Bareboat Rentals that are operated by licensed captains hired by Renter that are insured through the policy made available via the Services during the rental, the minimum age is 18.</p><h6>Insurance</h6><p>It is the Renter’s responsibility to &nbsp;review the insurance for their rental. Please review any insurance policy carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of, or relating to Renters or any hired Captains (and the individuals the Renter invites to the rental, if applicable) while on the Boat. &nbsp;If the Owner is using the Peer-to-Peer Boat Rental Insurance Policy through Geico it can be reviewed &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://boatbound.co/safety#insurance">here</a>, please send any questions to <a target="_blank">Boatsetterunderwriting@BoatUS.com</a> or call 877-510-2628.</p><h6>Appointment of Boatsetter as Limited Payment Agent for Owner</h6><p>Each Owner hereby appoints Boatsetter as the Owner's limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Renters on behalf of the Owner. Each Owner agrees that payment of Boat Fees made by a Renter to Boatsetter shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Owner and the Owner will make the Boat available to Renter in the agreed upon manner as if the Owner has received the Boat Fees. Each Owner agrees that Boatsetter may, in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Owner and reflected in the relevant Listing, (i) permit the Renter to cancel the booking and (ii) refund to the Renter that portion of the Boat Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized payment agent of the Owner, Boatsetter assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Owner.</p><p>From time to time, we may become aware of users attempting to conduct a transaction that would involve an unauthorized payment method or a fraudulent payment method. &nbsp;Ideally, we hope to be able to assist users in avoiding such transactions, but we assume no liability or responsibility to either do so or to inform users of any such actual or suspected activity.</p><p>You are immediately responsible to Boatsetter for all credit card disputes, refunds, reversals, or fines regardless of the reason or timing. In many but not all cases, you may have the ability to challenge such actions by submitting evidence to <a target="_blank">contact@Boatsetter.com</a>. We may request additional information to provide to Financial Services Providers to assist you in contesting the charge, but we cannot guarantee that your challenge will be successful. Financial Services Providers may deny your challenge for any reason they deem appropriate. Where a challenge is entirely or partially successful, a Financial Services Provider may credit funds associated with the charge that is the subject of the dispute (or a portion thereof).</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Please keep in mind that you are liable for all losses you incur when lost or stolen payment credentials or accounts are used to purchase products or services from you. Boatsetter does not and will not insure you against losses caused by fraud under any circumstances. For example, if someone pretends to be a legitimate Renter but is a fraudster, you will be responsible for any resulting costs, including credit card disputes, even if the Rental has been rendered. Even if we work with you to assist you or law enforcement in recovering lost funds, Boatsetter is not liable to you, or responsible for your financial losses or any other consequences of such fraud.</p><p><b><br></b></p><h6>No Charge for Listings</h6><p>Please note that Boatsetter does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings. However, you acknowledge and agree that Boatsetter reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees from you for the creation of Listings, or for other features of the Services. Please note that Boatsetter will provide notice of any such additional fees via the Services, prior to implementing such fees.</p><h6>Bookings and Financial Terms for Renters</h6><p>The Owners, not Boatsetter, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Boats reserved through the Services. If you, as a Renter, choose to enter into a transaction with an Owner for the booking of a Boat, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Owner and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Boat imposed by the Owner. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Boatsetter, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Boatsetter is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its obligations hereunder to pay Boat Fees to the applicable Owner, Boatsetter disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Boatsetter is not a party to the agreement between you and the Owner, Boatsetter acts as the Owner’s limited payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Owner. Upon your payment of amounts to Boatsetter which are due to the Owner, your payment obligation to the Owner for such amounts is extinguished, and Boatsetter is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Boatsetter’s Reservation Fees, to the Owner. In the event that Boatsetter does not remit any such amounts to an Owner, such Owner will have recourse for such amounts only against Boatsetter.</p><p>Listings for Boats will specify the Total Fees. As noted above, the Owner is required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Boatsetter in its sole discretion) or the requested booking may be automatically canceled. If a requested booking is canceled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Owner), any amounts collected by Boatsetter will be refunded to such Renter, depending on the selections the Renter makes via the Services, and any pre-authorization of such Renter’s credit card will be released, if applicable.</p><p>You agree to pay Boatsetter for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Boatsetter Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Owner. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Owner’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that Boatsetter, on behalf of the Owner, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1) to verify your credit card. Once Boatsetter receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Owner, Boatsetter will collect the Total Fees in accordance with these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Boatsetter cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Renter by his or her bank related to Boatsetter's collection of the Total Fees, and Boatsetter disclaims all liability in this regard.</p><p>In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Boatsetter or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Boatsetter for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Boatsetter Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Service – e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Boatsetter or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Services. You also authorize Boatsetter to charge your credit card in the event of damage caused on a Boat as contemplated under “Damage to Boats” below and for Security Deposits, if applicable. If you are directed to Boatsetter’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</p><h6>Payment Processing Errors and Chargebacks</h6><p>We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same payment method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount.</p><p>If an Owner is paid for a trip erroneously or a chargeback takes place, Boatsetter will first attempt to debit the funds from the provided bank account. &nbsp;If Boatsetter is unable to debit the funds to the Renter, the Owner is responsible for returning those funds within seven (7) days. Boatsetter may collect all future payouts until the erroneous payment or chargebacks have been resolved.</p><h6>Payment Processor Terms (Stripe)</h6><p>Payment processing services on Boatsetter are provided by Stripe and are subject to the <a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms">Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a>, which includes the <a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com/terms">Stripe Terms of Service</a> (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). You agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement. You also authorize Boatsetter to share with Stripe transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.</p><h6>Security Deposits</h6><p>Boatsetter includes a security deposit&nbsp;in every Listing (“Security Deposits”). For all Security Deposits included in a Listing for a confirmed booking of a Boat, Boatsetter will, in its capacity as the payment agent of the Owner, use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a pre-authorization of the Renter’s credit card in the amount the Owner determines for the Security Deposit within a reasonable time prior to the Renter's check-in at the applicable Owner’s Boat. Boatsetter will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Owners’ requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Boatsetter is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Owners related to Security Deposits, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</p><p>If an Owner does not respond to the questions related to a Security Deposit capture within 7 days of the rental date, the damages will be considered resolved. &nbsp;As a result, the Renter’s Security Deposit will be refunded and the Owner will no longer have any rights to the funds.</p><p>Renters are always responsible for having a card on file with sufficient funds available to cover the Security Deposit and any applicable deductible. &nbsp;Boatsetter reserves the right to cancel the booking if the Security Deposit was not captured within 24 hours of the rental. If a booking has concluded and the Security Deposit was not captured, Boatsetter reserves the right to charge any/all payment methods in order to secure the necessary funds.</p><h6>Service Fees</h6><p>In consideration for providing the Services, Boatsetter collects service fees from Owners and Renters. Service Fees are made up of two (2) components: (i) Reservation Fee and (ii) an Owner Commission Fee that is charged to the Owner, each is based upon a percentage of the amount of the Boat Fees. Where applicable, Taxes may also be charged. Owner Commission Fees are deducted from the Boat Fees before remitting the Boat Fees to the Owner. Reservation Fees are, as noted above, included in the Total Fees.</p><p>The agreed upon Owner payout amount will be remitted by Boatsetter to Owners via direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Services, in U.S. dollars.
